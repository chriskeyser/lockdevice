Arduino: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows#toc2, using 1.6.1

SHA256: https://github.com/Cathedrow/Cryptosuite.  Had to fix up print overloads for a few of the items.

Updates
- Fixed SHA256 compile errors
- Updated PubSubClient package size
- Updated PubSubClient to support setting server/port after running.  For some reason there was an initialization issue that I could not run down
                    after creating the client, and could not connect to mqtt client.
